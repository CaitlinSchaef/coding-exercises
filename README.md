# coding-exercises
A place to save coding exercises, mostly from Code Wars. 

Optional framework for working through exercises, PRECEPT: 
PRECEPT: 
Parameters: 
List the function parameters and note what data types you expect them to be.
Return value: 
Note the expected data type your function should return.
Example: 
Write example input values and output values. This is usually provided in the prompt on codewars.
Concerns: 
In what ways can your function fail?
 For example, if you are performing math but are given an input value that is of type String instead of type Number.
Explain your solution: 
Break the problem into smaller pieces that you can string together to arrive at a solution. This is like explaining what you will do to solve the problem to a 5th grader.
E.g. "To determine the century of year X, I will divide year X by 100. I will then round up my result to the nearest whole number."
Positive Self Talk: 
This is complicated stuff! Don't speak negatively about yourself. Keep a positive attitude and know you can do this.
Translate: 
Take your plain logic steps from the “Explain” section and write them as comments in your code editor. Then use the programming language for the Kata to implement that plain English logic into code!
